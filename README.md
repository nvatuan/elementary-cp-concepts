# Elementary CP Concepts
This is my blog for how to approach Competitive Programming. One can look at this as the entrance to become better as a CP'er. 
I wrote it for my friends who are wanting to improve their programming skills but realize that it could serve a greater purpose, so I pushed it onto github.
The blog is hosted on [this github.io](https://nvatuan.github.io/elementary-cp-concepts/).

Unfortunately, the materials are in Vietnamese, and the problems I prepared are not public. 

Currently, I don't have the chance to sit down and write more, but in the future, I'm looking forward to expand and move my materials to somewhere that is more accessible for everyone.
